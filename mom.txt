i need a poem about jonathan cruxible's mother. she is a wonderful woman that helps people all the time. she needs to take more time for her, but she don't. she's my mother and I love her, my brother and me want the best for her and try to help mas best we can. shes fun and exciting to be around and is a curious person about life.
A mother like no other,
Full of love and care,
Always putting others first,
Her heart so pure and rare.

Jonathan Cruxible's mother,
A woman of great worth,
Who helps others in need,
And spreads joy and mirth.

She's a wonder to behold,
Fun and exciting too,
Curious about life,
And always trying something new.

Her selflessness is inspiring,
But sometimes she forgets,
To take a little time for herself,
And let go of life's regrets.

So Jonathan and his brother,
Want to show her their love,
To help her take a break,
And soar like a dove.

For the woman who raised them,
And gave them so much,
They want to give back,
And feel her gentle touch.

A mother like no other,
A blessing from above,
Jonathan Cruxible's mother,
A symbol of pure love.
